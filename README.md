## what is mechatronics ?

### The integration of **mechanical engineering** with *electronics* and *intelligent computer control*.

## But why?

### Well, its all about **multi-disciplinary skills** and creating  **smart machines** that are aware of their surroundings and can make decisions.

#### Tell me more ! :point_down:
It can be viewed as '**modern mechanical engineering design**' in the sense that the design of the mechanical system must be performed together with that of the electrical/electronic and computer control aspects that will comprise the complete system.

#### Can we have some examples? 

A **robot** is a good example of a mechatronic system.
 Most robots integrate software, electronics, and mechanical designs in a synergistic manner
#### WAIT what is synergy?

meaning that the separate parts act together in such a way that the combined effect is stronger than the sum of the separate effects of each one of the components

#### Other examples?
 Other examples of mechatronics are the **digital thermostat** and the **anti-lock brake system.** Both were originally designed as mechanical systems and have been improved later by their integration with electronic controls and digital computing elements.

### OK! Thats enough theory lets start building robots.
